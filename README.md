### About me

Hi! I'm a Software Developer from the land of the Incas, Peru.

I have 10 years of experience working in the software industry. I mainly develop end-to-end systems using JavaScript, Python, and Java.
Nowadays, my work is AI-boosted, and I have strong code review skills that help me deliver the most professional, secure, and efficient results.

I enjoy creating video games in Roblox using Lua and in Unity with C#.

I run a small software company where we provide AI tools for businesses. Visit novaworks.dev.
